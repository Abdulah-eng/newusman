/**
 * Test script to validate the dual authentication system
 * This script helps verify that the admin/manager login system is working properly
 */

console.log('🔐 Testing Dual Authentication System')
console.log('=====================================\n')

console.log('✅ Features Implemented:')
console.log('1. Dual login interface with admin/manager selection')
console.log('2. Role-based authentication validation')
console.log('3. Role-specific navigation and permissions')
console.log('4. Visual role indicators (crown for admin, user icon for manager)')
console.log('5. Role-based dashboard content')
console.log('6. Secure role validation during login\n')

console.log('🧪 Test Scenarios:')
console.log('1. Try logging in as admin with manager credentials → Should fail')
console.log('2. Try logging in as manager with admin credentials → Should fail')
console.log('3. Login with correct role → Should succeed')
console.log('4. Check navigation items based on role')
console.log('5. Verify dashboard content changes based on role\n')

console.log('📋 Manual Testing Steps:')
console.log('1. Go to /admin/login')
console.log('2. Select "Admin Login" or "Manager Login"')
console.log('3. Enter credentials for the selected role')
console.log('4. Verify you can only login if the account matches the selected role')
console.log('5. Check that navigation and dashboard adapt to your role\n')

console.log('🔧 Database Requirements:')
console.log('- managers table with role column (admin/manager)')
console.log('- is_active column for account status')
console.log('- Proper Supabase auth integration\n')

console.log('🎯 Expected Behavior:')
console.log('- Admin users see all navigation items including Orders and Manager Accounts')
console.log('- Manager users see limited navigation (no Orders, no Manager Accounts)')
console.log('- Role validation prevents cross-role login attempts')
console.log('- Visual indicators show current user role')
console.log('- Dashboard content adapts to user role\n')

console.log('✨ System is ready for testing!')
