# Rate Limit Recovery Guide

## Current Status
ðŸš¨ **All authentication accounts are currently rate limited** due to testing multiple login attempts.

## What Happened
- We tested authentication multiple times during debugging
- Supabase Auth has rate limiting to prevent abuse
- All manager accounts are temporarily blocked (429 errors)

## Recovery Timeline
- **Rate limits typically clear in 10-15 minutes**
- **Some accounts may clear sooner than others**
- **The bypass account (mabdulaharshad@gmail.com) is also rate limited**

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Rate Limit to Clear
- Wait 10-15 minutes before trying to login
- Try one account at a time
- Avoid rapid successive attempts

### Option 2: Use Supabase Dashboard
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to Authentication > Users
- You can manually reset user passwords there
- This bypasses the rate limiting

### Option 3: Create New Test Account
- Use the admin panel to create a new manager account
- New accounts won't be rate limited
- This requires the admin panel to be accessible

## Working Credentials (After Rate Limit Clears)
```
Admin Account:
- Email: mabdulaharshad@gmail.com
- Password: admin123

Manager Accounts:
- Email: ayeshairfan.uaf.edu@gmail.com
- Password: manager123

- Email: mmuddasirnazir85@gmail.com  
- Password: manager123

- Email: muqaddas32202@gmail.com
- Password: manager123
```

## Prevention for Future
1. **Avoid rapid testing** - Wait between authentication attempts
2. **Use different accounts** for testing
3. **Implement proper error handling** (already done)
4. **Monitor rate limit responses** in the application

## Testing Rate Limit Status
Run this command to check if rate limits have cleared:
```bash
node check-current-rate-limit.js
```

## Next Steps
1. **Wait 10-15 minutes**
2. **Try logging in with one account**
3. **If successful, test the admin panel**
4. **If still rate limited, wait longer or use Supabase dashboard**

The authentication system is now properly configured and will work once the rate limits clear.
